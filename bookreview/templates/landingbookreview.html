        <p>
            Each month we have a competition where you are able to vote and win. On the first of each month we 
            preview three books on Miller Merchant and allow you to vote  on what one you think we should add to 
            our store.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the votes have been calculated and the winning book confirmed at the end of the month it will then 
            be added. What makes it special is that the first 100 copies of the winning book will be signed by the 
            author so make sure that you are quick to grab your copy.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone that votes is automatically enrolled into our prize draw and the winner will be selected at random 
            and the lucky voter will win a copy of the signed book with a personalised message from the author. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Every month we will have an exclusive interview with the author of the winning book. They will give you an 
            insight into the thinking behind the book and really set the scene while your copy is on its way to you. 
        </p>
        <p>
